# Automating-phishing-attacks-using-SOAR
I utilized the Shuffle platform to implement a beginner workflow focused on handling phishing emails. 
    The workflow method I implemented is as follows: 
        Firstly, I retrieve an email from an inbox, where I intentionally sent a simulated phishing email. This email is then forwarded to an email analyzer, which           extracts valuable information from its content. Subsequently, I employ the Sotty app to identify and resolve any URLs embedded within the email.  To ensure a         comprehensive analysis, I leverage VirusTotal to scrutinize the IP addresses associated with the identified URLs. Additionally, I validate the eligibility of         the certificate authority by utilizing a Python script. Based on specific conditions, an alert is generated in a Teams room. If deemed necessary, I possess           the capability to delete the suspicious email, thereby mitigating potential risks.
